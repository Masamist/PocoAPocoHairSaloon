## Introduction
This project is a solo project working with a real client an opportunity to research CMS and their benefits and how they are configured. 
I created a static website, then included the CMS as a customer linking to the CMS site when they make a reservation. For ‘pocp a poco’ the CMS, I selected was SimplyBook.me. This is web based software CMS which enables you to create a booking then synchronize your booking on your calendar, also has features like managing membership and email remainder.

## Project Overview
This Web project was to create a website using a Content Management System (CMS). 
The client is ‘poco a poco’ hair saloon located in Newmarket, Auckland. 
Poco a poco takes reservations by phone, which sometimes creates mistakes such as double bookings or writing down the wrong date or time, 
the client has decided to introduce an online booking system which minimizes the number of calls for reservations.
